Description: Estimate the presence of splicing events from expression data
    The package performs 4 functions:
    1) Find the constitutively expressed exons within each gene from expression data.
    2) Cluster alternative exons in splicing groups based on their correlation.
    3) Calculate the expression of constitutive and alternative exon groups.
    4) (optional) Normalize the expression of alternative exons to whole-gene expression (splicing ratios)
