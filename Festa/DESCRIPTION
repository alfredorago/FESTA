Title: Flexible Exon-based Splicing and Transcription Annotation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alfredo Rago
Maintainer: Alfredo Rago <alfredo.rago@gmail.com>
Description: Estimate the presence of splicing events from expression data
    The package performs 3 functions:
    1) Find the constitutively expressed exons within each gene
    2) Cluster alternative exons based on their correlation
    3) Calculate the expression of constitutive and alternative exon groups
    The expression of alternative exons can be also normalized to whole-gene expression (splicing ratios)
