# FESTA
Flexible Exon-based Splicing and Transcription Annotation

The FESTA script allows the detection of new splicing events starting only from exon-based expression data.
The only input files required are a count table and an annotatio table that matches each exon to a gene.
The output contains expression values for both the main gene and its isoform.
The latter can be further normalized to proportions of the total gene expression.
For more information, refer to the paper in the Doc Folder.

This repository serves two purposes:
  1) Document the scripts used in the paper Rago et al. (Folder RagoEtAl)
  2) Make the implementation available for more users (Work in progress)
